# Sound Escapes visuals

This repository contains the source code and related files for the visuals for the [Sound Escapes concert](http://www.ryankelln.com/project/sound-escapes/), in collaboration with [Spectrum Music](https://www.spectrummusic.ca/).

Inspired by the wild and uninhibited beauty of nature, the concert features a collaboration of 6 emerging composers, an amazing jazz trio and video art. Each original composition has imagery hand crafted from found footage, local landscapes and images generated by machine learning / artificial intelligence, all made with open source software. The concert speaks to a love of nature and the technological revolution that is ahead for humanity.
